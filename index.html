                <p class="breadcrumb"><a href="#degree-information">Degree Information</a> -> Undergraduate</p>
		<p>The Department of Computer Science is within the Roy G. Perry College of Engineering. 
		All students seeking admission into the Computer Science undergraduate program must meet the undergraduate admission requirements 
		of the university and the admission requirements of the College of Engineering.</p>
		<p>For <b>UNIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS</b> please refer to the University Catalog for the most current University admissions requirements.</p>
		<p>Students seeking admission to the Computer Science program at Prairie View A & M University should complete a university application for admission.</p>
		<p><h2>INSTRUCTIONAL ORGANIZATION</h2></p>
		<p>The Roy G. Perry College of Engineering is composed of six academic departments offering the degree programs listed below:</p>
		<p><h4>Degree Programs	Degrees Offered</h4></p>
		<p>Chemical Engineering	B.S.Ch.E.</p>
		<p>Civil Engineering	B.S.C.E.</p>
		<p>Computer Engineering	B.S. </p>
		<p>Computer Science	B.S.</p>
		<p>Electrical Engineering	B.S.E.E.</p>

		<p>Computer Engineering Technology	B.S.CET.</p>
		<p>Electrical Engineering Technology	B.S.EET.</p>
		<p>Computer-Aided Drafting and Design Technology	B.S.I.T.</p>
		<p><b>Admission to the Roy G. Perry College of Engineering</b></p>
		<p>Admission to the Roy G. Perry College of Engineering is based on the University's undergraduate admission requirements plus the following additional admission criteria for the College of Engineering. 
		Students may be admitted to the College of Engineering in two ways: (1) directly into a major or (2) conditionally admitted. 
		A student is admitted directly into a major only if all admission criteria are met. </p>
		<p>First-time Freshmen - Engineering and Computer Science Majors</p>
		<p>First-time freshmen will be evaluated on the basis of the following admission criteria that are applicable for the student:
		<ul>
			<li>Students must meet the Prairie View A&M University admissions requirements.</li>
			<li>Students must present a SAT score of 930 (based on combined verbal and math scores only) or higher or a composite ACT score of 19 or higher.</li>
			<li>Must have a cumulative high school GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.</li>
			<li>Student must be in the top 25 percent of their graduating class.</li>
			<li>Students must have successfully passed or must be exempt from the THEA exam in all areas.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>THEA requirements have no influence on the admission to the University; however students must satisfy this criterion to be admitted to the College of Engineering. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the student’s major status being changed.</p>
		<p>As noted, students who meet these criteria will be admitted directly into a major. Those students that do not meet the criteria will need to have their records reviewed by their academic department and be considered on individual merits for conditional admission.</p>
		<p><b>Conditional Admittance</b></p>
		<p>Those first-time freshmen who do not meet the direct admission standards into the College and wish to be considered for conditional admission must meet the following criteria:</p>
		<p><b>First-time Freshmen - Engineering and Computer Science Majors</b></p>
		<p>First-time freshmen will be evaluated on the basis of the following admission criteria that are applicable for the student: 
		<ul>
			<li>Students must meet the Prairie View A&M University admissions requirements.</li>
			<li>Students must present a minimum SAT score greater than 820 (based on combined verbal and math scores only) or higher or a composite ACT score of 17 or higher.</li>
			<li>Must have a minimum cumulative high school GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale.</li>
			<li>Student must be in the top 50 percent of their graduating class.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Students Entering with Transfer Credit</p>
		<p>Transfer students include those from other units within Prairie View A&M University as well as those from other educational institutions. Transfer students external to Prairie View A&M University must furnish an official transcript to the Office of Admissions for evaluation of all college level work completed. 
		Transfer students with less than 30 hours of transferable credit are admitted under the criteria for first-time freshmen. </p>
		<p>Transfer students with 30 hours or more of transferable credit must meet the following requirements:
		<ul>
			<li>Students must meet the Prairie View A&M University and the College of Engineering admissions requirements.</li>
			<li>Must have a ‘C’ or higher in all transfer courses.</li>
			<li>Must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale in all math, science, and engineering courses.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Students who meet these criteria will be admitted directly into a major. Those students that do not meet the criteria will need to have their records reviewed by their desired academic department and be considered on individual merits for conditional admission. </p>
		<p><b>Placement in an Engineering Major</b></p>
		<p>Students meeting all admission criteria for entry directly from high school or for entry with transfer credit will be admitted as a program major: CHEG (Chemical Engineering), CVEG (Civil Engineering), CPEG (Computer Engineering), ELEG (Electrical Engineering), MCEG (Mechanical Engineering), CPSC (Computer Science), 
		ELET (Electrical Engineering Technology), CPET (Computer Engineering Technology), and CADD (Computer-Aided Drafting and Design). 
		If all criteria are not met, students who have decided on their major may be conditionally admitted: UCHE (Chemical Engineering), UCVE (Civil Engineering), UCPG (Computer Engineering), UELE (Electrical Engineering), UMCE (Mechanical Engineering), UCPS (Computer Science), UELT (Electrical Engineering Technology), 
		UCPT (Computer Engineering Technology), and UCAD (Computer-Aided Drafting and Design). Students conditionally admitted can apply to their department for advancement after 30 hours of completed course work (see the above Conditional Admittance Section).</p>
		<p>Along with meeting the general requirements of the University, students enrolled in the College of Engineering must maintain the following performance levels in order to satisfy degree requirements:
		<ul>
			<li>Earn an overall grade point average of 2.0 or better in courses taken outside of the college and earn a grade of C or better in English, mathematics, and science courses.</li>
			<li>Earn a grade of C or better in each course taken within the College.</li>
			<li>Earn a grade of C or better in the prerequisite before advancing to the next level course in a sequence for English, mathematics, and science courses.</li>
			<li>Earn a grade of C or better in prerequisite courses before advancing to the next level course in College courses.</li>
			<li>Demonstrate professional standards and ethical conduct.</li>
			<li>Three-Attempt Rule: A student may not attempt a course at PVAMU in the College of Engineering more than three times and apply that course toward an engineering degree. Enrollment in a course for a period of time sufficient for assignment of a grade, including a grade of W, is considered an attempt.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Students who transfer from other colleges and universities should meet the University’s scholastic regulations and additional core curriculum requirements for engineering.</p>
